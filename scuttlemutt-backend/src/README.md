# Scuttlemutt App

We'll hopefully make a better README later, but here's some guidance on these top-level directories.
- `backend` - This directory contains the backend processes such as the "IO manager", "mesh daemon", and "bark daemon".
- `frontend` - This directory contains the APIs used for network initialization and messaging.
- `storagemanager` - This directory contains the classes used for data storage.
- `types` - This directory contains the various objects used throughout Scuttlemutt as data types.
