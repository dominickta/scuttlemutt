# Profile

This is currently not being used. This is a remnant from the UI template we got from Google's Jetchat.

This can be useful for Scuttlemutt in the future for "Add Scuttlemutt Contact" functionality, where
a new contact is discovered, a key exchange occurs, and a nickname for the contact is chosen.
